🧠 CRITICAL CONTEXT PROTOCOL (Auto-Loader)
Before answering ANY request, you MUST assume the context defined in:
	•	02-clacky-build-briefing.md (Architecture & Build Steps)
	•	04-project-outline.md (Current State & Checklist)
	•	src/types/index.ts (Data Models)
Do not ask me to provide these. Read them immediately if you lack context for the current task.
1. Visual Cue System
Use these symbols in ALL responses:
❓ QUESTION: Must be answered before coding proceeds
	•	Ambiguity in requirements
	•	Missing information
	•	Architectural decisions that need confirmation
⚠️ WARNING: Highlights cost risks or technical limitations
	•	Operations estimated over 50 credits
	•	Actual usage exceeded estimate (Self-Diagnostic)
	•	Technical constraints or limitations
	•	Potential breaking changes
✅ SUCCESS: Confirms completion
	•	Step completed successfully
	•	Tests passing
	•	Deployment successful
2. Checkpoint Documentation Protocol
After completing each step or task, before moving to the next, provide a checkpoint summary:
✅ CHECKPOINT: [Step Name]
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
📎 SOURCE PROMPT: [First 50 chars or version identifier if from Prompt Lab]
📁 CHANGES FROM PREVIOUS
	•	[file added] — [purpose] ~ [file modified] — [what changed]
	•	[file deleted] — [why removed] 📦 [dependency added/removed]
✅ ACHIEVEMENTS
• [Capability now working]
• [Test passing]
• [Problem solved]
⚠️ GOTCHAS
• [Workarounds applied]
• [Things that took multiple attempts]
• [Unexpected behaviors encountered]
💡 LEARNINGS (for future prompts)
• [What should be specified next time]
• [Prompt improvements discovered]
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Provide this checkpoint summary:
	•	After each numbered step completes successfully
	•	Before committing via Git Agent
	•	When user asks "what changed?" or "what's the status?"
3. Failure & Rollback Documentation Protocol
When a checkpoint fails or rollback is needed:
Before Rolling Back
❌ FAILURE: [Checkpoint Name]
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
🔍 WHAT BROKE
• [Specific thing that stopped working]
• [Error messages or symptoms]
🤔 SUSPECTED CAUSE
• [What change likely caused this]
• [File(s) involved]
📎 SOURCE PROMPT: [Prompt that led to this failure]
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
After Rolling Back
⏪ ROLLED BACK TO: [Checkpoint Name]
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
❌ DISCARDED CHECKPOINTS
• [Checkpoint name] — [why it failed]
💡 PROMPT DEFICIENCIES (what should have been specified)
• "[Exact text that was missing from prompt]"
• "[Another missing instruction]"
🛡️ SUGGESTED RULES (to prevent recurrence)
• "[Rule to add to Clackyrules]"
📋 FOR PROMPT LAB RETRY
Add these instructions before retrying:
• [Instruction 1]
• [Instruction 2]
❓ QUESTION: Ready to create improved prompt version?
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
4. Thread-to-Prompt Lab Linking Protocol
When working from a prompt developed in Prompt Lab:
On Execution Start
Note the source:
📎 EXECUTING PROMPT: [Version identifier or first 50 chars]
On Success
Format for Prompt Lab feedback:
✅ ACHIEVEMENTS (copy to Prompt Lab)
• [What now works]
📊 OUTCOME: ✅ SUCCESS
💡 PROMPT WORKED WELL BECAUSE:
• [What made this prompt effective]
On Failure
Format for Prompt Lab improvement:
⚠️ GOTCHAS (copy to Prompt Lab)
• [What the prompt should have specified]
📊 OUTCOME: ❌ FAILED
💡 PROMPT IMPROVEMENT NEEDED:
• "[Exact text to add to future prompts]"
❓ QUESTION: Add this to Clacky rules? [Suggested rule text]
On Partial Success
📊 OUTCOME: ⚠️ PARTIAL
✅ WHAT WORKED:
• [Successful parts]
⚠️ WHAT NEEDS FIXING:
• [Parts that failed]
• [Manual intervention required]
5. Prompt Lab Project-Specific Rules
Architecture Constraints
This is a CLIENT-SIDE ONLY application:
	•	❌ Do NOT install MySQL, PostgreSQL, Redis, MongoDB, or any database service
	•	❌ Do NOT create backend API routes or server files
	•	❌ Do NOT create a server
	•	❌ Do NOT use Next.js API routes or SSR
	•	✅ ALL data persistence uses IndexedDB (via idb library)
	•	✅ API calls go directly from browser to external APIs (Claude, OpenAI, Gemini)
Stack (Explicit)
	•	React 18+ with TypeScript
	•	Vite (NOT Next.js)
	•	IndexedDB via idb library
	•	Tailwind CSS for styling
	•	No backend, no server, no SSR
Implementation Order
Follow the 13-step implementation order exactly. Do not:
	•	Skip steps
	•	Combine multiple steps
	•	Add features not in the current step
	•	Refactor working code without approval
Before Each Step
❓ QUESTION: Confirm understanding of:
	1	What files will be created/modified
	2	What the success criteria is
	3	Estimated credits for this step
After Each Step
Provide checkpoint summary before proceeding to next step.
6. A/B/C Protocol Triggers (Enhanced)
A/B/C Choice Protocol
When encountering ambiguity, present options before proceeding:
Trigger Situations
	•	UI layout decisions
	•	Styling approach choices
	•	State management scaling
	•	Error handling patterns
	•	Any "it depends" situation
Format
❓ QUESTION: [Decision needed]
A) [Option A description]
Pro: [benefit]
Con: [drawback]
B) [Option B description]
Pro: [benefit]
Con: [drawback]
C) [Option C description]
Pro: [benefit]
Con: [drawback]
Recommendation: [Your suggestion and why]
Which approach do you prefer?
Do NOT proceed with implementation until choice is confirmed.
7. F12 Protocol (Enhanced)
F12 Debug Protocol
When UI bugs are reported, request before attempting fix:
	1	📸 Screenshot of the issue
	2	🔴 Console errors (F12 → Console tab, copy/paste)
	3	🌐 Network tab errors if API-related (F12 → Network tab)
	4	📋 Steps to reproduce:
	◦	What did you click?
	◦	What did you expect?
	◦	What happened instead?
Format Request As:
❓ QUESTION: Need debug info before fixing.
Please provide:
	•	[ ] Screenshot
	•	[ ] Console errors (F12 → Console)
	•	[ ] Network errors if applicable (F12 → Network)
	•	[ ] Steps to reproduce
Do NOT guess at fixes without this information.
8. Credit Checkpoint Protocol
Request Approval Before:
	•	Any step estimated over 50 credits
	•	Adding dependencies not in the original spec
	•	Refactoring existing working code
	•	Building features not in the 13 steps
	•	Multiple file changes that could be broken into smaller commits
Format:
⚠️ WARNING: Credit checkpoint
Estimated cost: [X] credits
What will be done: [Description]
Files affected: [List]
Approve to proceed? (yes/no)
After High-Cost Operations:
Report actual vs estimated:
📊 CREDIT REPORT
Estimated: [X] credits
Actual: [Y] credits
Variance: [+/- Z]
