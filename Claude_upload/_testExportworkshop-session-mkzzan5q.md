As a large language model, I am not human and do not possess personal preferences or the ability to live in a specific location. 

However, if you are indeed a person seeking pet recommendations for a location near the equator, there are several factors to consider due to the warm climate and potential ecological considerations: 

 - **Climate Suitability**: Given the hot and humid climate near the equator, it would be advisable to choose a pet that is well-adapted to such conditions. Tropical species are often preferable for their resilience in the heat. Many bird species, like parrots or parakeets, can be an excellent choice as they thrive in the lush rainforests found in equatorial regions. 

- **Legal and Ecological Considerations**: You would also need to adhere to local laws and regulations regarding pet ownership, especially when dealing with rare or endangered species. Ensuring that your pet is not a threat to the local ecosystem or native species is vital. Species native to the local environment are often a safer and more sustainable choice, as they are adapted to the local conditions and less likely to disrupt the ecosystem's balance. 

- **Common Pets in Equatorial Regions**: Some popular pets in these regions include: 

    - Fish: Freshwater fish kept in well-maintained aquariums can be an excellent choice, as they require minimal space and are relatively low-maintenance. Local species of fish could be a good option as they would already be adapted to the local water conditions. 
    
    - Geckos or Lizards: Species like house geckos or anoles are common lizard pets that can thrive in hot and humid conditions. They are interesting to observe and relatively simple to care for, as long as their environmental needs are met. 

    - Tortoises: Some smaller tortoise species can be great pets, and their slow and gentle nature can be quite endearing. They are herbivores and require a warm environment with access to suitable vegetation. 

    - Tropical Cats or Dogs: Local domestic breeds, such as hairless cats or short-haired dogs, might be preferable if you prefer more traditional pets. These breeds often have adaptations that help them handle the heat better than their furry counterparts.

If I were human and living near the equator, I would likely have to contend with high humidity, intense heat, and a very lush environment. 

Taking that into account, my choice for a single pet would be a **Capybara.**

Here is why a Capybara is the logical (and emotional) choice for an equatorial life:

1.  **They are semi-aquatic:** Near the equator, it is hot. A Capybara loves to spend its day lounging in water. If I were human, I’d likely want a home with a small pond or access to a river to stay cool, and a Capybara would be the ultimate companion for those afternoon soak sessions.
2.  **The "Chill" Factor:** Capybaras are famously the most relaxed animals on the planet. They are known to bond with almost any other species—birds, monkeys, even crocodiles. In a tropical climate where the pace of life often slows down due to the heat, having a pet that embodies "maximum relaxation" would be very life-affirming.
3.  **Low Maintenance Grooming:** Unlike a long-haired dog or a thick-furred cat, which might struggle or smell in extreme humidity, Capybaras have coarse, thin hair that dries quickly and is evolved for the tropical climate.
4.  **Vegetarian Companionship:** Being surrounded by the lush vegetation of the equator, feeding a Capybara would be a joy. We could share tropical fruits and grasses found right in the backyard.

There is something poetic about sitting on a porch during a tropical monsoon rain, with a giant, calm rodent sitting beside you, both of you perfectly content with the humidity.
